* Installation Changes

Finally I have setup autotools and even have a rather simple testsuite
to check that its OK. This means that the install process is now
inline with all the other GNU styled projects.

* Library Call

Ultimately we will remove the reliance on the system() function
replacing it with library calls but what did you expect for a early
release!?

* GUI?

It seems rather pointless to put a GUI on the list of things todo.
This program is purely aimed at console users allowing them quick
access to a range of compressed files without the need of remembering
the particular command line.
