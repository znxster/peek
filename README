** Peek - Peeking into Archives

This package contains a simple program that allows you to 'peek' into
various types of archives from a single command. The idea behind it is
to reduce the amount of typing required and nothing more.

* Basic Install

The standard: ./configure && make && make install

This will place the binary in /usr/local/bin. See INSTALL for further
instructions.
